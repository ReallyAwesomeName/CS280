The objective of this simple assignment is to write a simple program, just to make sure you can edit, compile and run a C++ program via Vocareum system.

Write a C++ program that displays a message as "Welcome to CS 280.", and prompts the user to enter his or her first and last names "What is your first and last names?". The program should read the user’s first and last names as strings and display a welcoming message that includes the student’s full name. A full dialogue example is shown below:

```text
Welcome to CS 280.

What is your first and last names?

George Fritz

Hello, George Fritz
```

## Note

Use the same format and phrases for the input and output as shown for full credit. However, testing your program on your environment would require an input from the user to be entered for the name. For automatic grading on Vocareum, the input will be provided from an input file which includes some name instead, for example “George” in the example above.
